These assets was made for vanilla minecraft mapmaking (java edition), which means most of them are in java block/items format.  
And those models under [`models > generic-model`](https://github.com/SL0ANE/Loy-s-Goodies/tree/main/models/generic-model) would be compatible with the plugin [Animated Java](https://animated-java.dev).  
Feel free to use models in this repository in your own maps or other projects.  

Credit the repository with a link would be appriciated.
